# The Royal Game of Ur

The Royal Game of Ur is an ancient Sumerian game, Ur being the Sumerian city in Mesapotamia, current Iraq, where the first game boards were found. 
It was played from around 2.500 BC until late antiquity, when it was replaced or evolved into Backgammon.

For an introduction to both the history and the rules of the game, I highly recommend this very entertaining YouTube video.
In this video, dr. Irving Finkel, curator of the British Museum and the discoverer and translator of a clay tablet from 177 BC describing the rules of the game,
explains the rules and history of the game, and plays a game against popular youtuber Tom Scott.

## The rules
- There are two players, which each have 7 stones
- The goal is to move all of your stones along the route indicated and to the finish, before your opponent does so.
- A player throws 4 tetrahedral dice with 2 corners each marked, or equivalently a coin. The number of marked corners that point up, or the number of heads, 
is the number of squares a stone may move.
- The choice to make is which stone to move forward the rolled number of squares.
- You may not land on your own stones.
- You may land on your opponent's stone, which will capture it and return it to the start.
- If you land on a rosette, you get another turn and the stone on the rosette cannot be captured.
- To move a stone off the board, it must move exactly one square off the board, not more.
- If no move is possible, the turn goes back to the other player.
